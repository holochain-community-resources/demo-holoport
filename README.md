This document is a quick guide and checklist for Holochain community organizers who want to give a Holoport demo during one of their community events.

Feel free to adjust, modify or add your ideas and flavours, since every community, organizer and event are unique and have their style and requirements.

If you would like to add or update something in this document, please make a pull request, and I will review and merge. Thanks in advance!

## ‚úÖ Checklist
1. Make sure you have a Holoport or Holoport+ at your disposal. Plus the box, if you want to do a little 'unboxing'. :)
2. The Holoport doesn't support WIFI out-of-the-box, so make sure there is an ethernet connection which you can use.
3. Make sure there is a beamer or big screen available.
4. If you want to connect to the Holoport directly, make sure you have a keyboard/mouse/screen available to connect to the Holoport.
5. If you already registered the Holoport and want to re-register it during the event, make sure to do a factory reset before the event, [as described here](https://forum.holo.host/t/holoport-factory-reset/195). It will re-create the previous registration, so you can do it as many times as you want.
6. It is always nice to have some cookies üç™, water, tea or softdrinks available.
7. Wearing a Holo-shirt and have some shiny stickers will make the event even more top-notch.

## Introduction
During the introduction it is nice to have a bit of background and context. A couple of slides will be really usefull for this.
