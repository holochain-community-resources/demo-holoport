# Holoport Demo

This is a quickguide and checklist for Holochain community organizers, who want to give a Holoport demo event during one of their community events. Feel free to adjust, modify or add your own ideas and flavours, since every community, organizer and event are unique and have their own style and requirements.

If you would like to add or update something in this document, please make a pull request and I will review and merge. Thanks in advance!
